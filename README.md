# Sudoku-Solver-using-Bitmasking-in-C-
A fast and efficient Sudoku solver implemented in C++ using recursive backtracking and bitmasking. This program reads a partially filled 9x9 Sudoku grid, solves it by pruning invalid placements with bit manipulation for rows, columns, and 3x3 boxes, and prints the completed puzzle.
